Decentralized agreement
Decentralized Transaction
Decentralized Organisations (DAO: Decentralized Autonomous Organisations)
    smart contracts is a set of instructions executed in a decentralised wway without 
    the need for a centrailzed or third party intermedialry

Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)
web3: permissionless, decentralized, dynamic data.
        -immutable -decentralized -transparent.

Lesson 2.
wallet essentials: public key, private key, seed phase. 
Gas: A unit of ccomputational measurement. Thee more complex your transaction is the more
    gass you have to pay.
HOW THE BLOCK CHAIN WORKS
SHA256 hash.
ethererum: uses the keccak256 hash algorithm
HASH ALGORITHM: A function that computess data into a unique hash.
Hash: A unique fixeed length string, meant to identify a piece of data, 
    they aree created by placcing said dtat into a "hash function"
Genesis Blok: the first block in a blockhain
Mining: The proeess of finding the solution to the blockchain "problem"
In our example, the prooblem was to find a hash that starts with four zeros.
Nodes get paid for minning blocks.
Nonce: A "number" used one to find the "solution" to the blockchain prooblem.
It's also used to define the transcation number for an acccount/address.
private key: only known to the key holdeer, it's used to "sign" transations
public key: is derived from your private key. Anyone can "see" it and use it to 
    verify that a transaction came fro you.
    Node: a single instane in a deecentralized network.

blockchain consensus mechanism
1. chain selection:
2. sybil resistance PoW (proof of work)
    PoS (proof of stake)
    chain seelection rule:  Nakamoto consensus: combination of PoW and longest chain. the longest chain.
    block confirmations number of chains ahead of it in the chain.

ETH 2.0 prove of stake.

block reward and transaction  fees: prices won by the Node.

types of blockchain attacks.
===========================
1. sybil Attack: the attacker hass to hass to create a lots of account and node in other
    to take over the network is is economically imposssible because it has to over
    still do the work or have a stake to make this happen.
2. 51% Attack: if you have the longest chain and it matches up with more 51% of the network
    then the chain can be forked to your chain.

Proof of work cost a lot of eelectricity.
PoS: chains already using pow eg. avalache, polygon, phantom etc.
    proof of stake nodes put up collateral as a sybil resistance mechanism.
validators: (miners are noow called validators)
Randomness: 
Pros of PoW: great mecchanism against Sybil attack.
            easy to proof who the author of a new block is.
            less complicated i.e uses much less energy.
            Scalability: gas price may keep rising has more ppl join the use of blockchain
            sharding: main chain that coordinate a lot  of other micro chain.

Layer 1: Base layer blockchain implementation. e.g bitcoin, ethereeum, avalanche. 
Layer 2: Any application built on top of layer 1. eg. chainlink, abitrum, optimism (rollup) ssolve some of the 
    leyer problems.
